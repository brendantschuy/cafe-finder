CafeFinder is the premier tool for cafe enthusiasts to keep track of personal favorites, find a good spot to crank out an essay, or get their hands on the best coffee and scones in town. CafeFinder uses a custom Google Maps display to show cafes in an area, along with a rating determined by CafeFinder users. There's a rating for coffee quality, environment, and price.

- quality
- environment
- price

There are three main pages on CafeFinder. There's a list of all cafes near a person, sortable by various criteria. There's a map using Google Maps API -- each cafe on the map will appear with the rating system listed above. In order to save on my own database bandwidth, cafes will only be saved on the website if a user specifically requests information about one. All cafes in Portland will be saved by default for the proof of concept. Lastly, users will be able to save cafes on a personal list of favorites.
